# About

I've created this utility because some windows suck to behave rationally. 

#### Examples:

- **Volume Mixer**: It opens the upper left corner.
- **Power Query Advanced Editor**: Both the window and the font are too small.

# Features:
- Can resize a window by the specified width & height factors.
- Can place a window in the center of the screen.
- Can send keys to the window like CTRL-SHIFT-PLUS to zoom-in Power Query's Advanced Editor.
